Here is the results from the hwt:

  Original signal: [10.0, 12.0, 12.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.1, 8.2, 9.4, 16.0, 15.0, 13.0, 11.0, 6.4, 9.0, 19.0, 118.0]
  Ord FHWT  : [17.69375, -8.23125, 0.7874999999999996, -12.175, 0.75, -0.125, 1.75, -30.4, -1.0, 2.5, -0.5499999999999998, -0.60000

  The hwt constant is -2. Using this we can evaluate the results of the hwt to gain a deeper knowldege
  of the changes in the data about the river flow in cm^3 from December 1992 to January 1993.

Here is the summary of the data:
    The semi-weekly measurements of river flow, in cubic feet per second, cover the period
  of December 1992 to January 1993. The measurements are not exact, they are only approximations.
  They are accurate approximations but are not exact. The average river flow from December '92 to
  January '93 is 17.69 cm^3. The river flow's volume increased from December to January by 16.46 cm^3.
  From the 1st half of December '92 to the second half, the river flow decreased slightly by a margin
  of 1.57 cm^3. From the first half of January to the second half of January, the river flow increased
  by a margin of 24.35 cm^3. The river flow slightly decreased between the periods of the first quarter
  of December '92 to the second quarter by a margin of 1.5 cm^3. The change in river flow between the
  third quarter of December to the fourth quarter was a decrease by a margin of 0.25. The quarterly
  changes in river flow for January '93 are: from first to second: a decrease by 3.5 cm^3; from third
  to fourth: a decent increase by 60.8 cm^3. Now for the weekly changes in river flow for each month.
  December '92: Week 1: an increase by 2 cm^3; Week 2: a decrease by 5 cm^3; Week 3: an increase of 1.1 cm^3;
  Week 4: an increase by 1.2 cm^3. January '93: Week 1: a decrease by 1 cm^3; Week 2: a decrease by 2 cm^3;
  Week 3: an increase of 2.6 cm^3; Week 4: a big increase of 99 cm^3!



Data Set 2:

  The measurements of degrees Celsius in the Langstroth beehive are from 12:23 July 26, 2016 to 17:54
on August 9, 2016. The average temperature over this period is 28.79 degrees Celsius. The change in temp
from the first half of the period to the second half of the period is a decrease by about 1.1 degrees Celsius
The change in temperature from the first quarter to the second quarter is a decrease by about 0.59 degrees Celsius.
The change in temperature from the third quarter to the fourth quarter is an increase by roughly 1.2 degrees Celsius.
